    <p>Jeremy Elbertson[1][2] (born September 22, 1985), better known as Jerma985 or mononymously as Jerma (/ˈdʒɜːrmə/), is an American live streamer, YouTuber, and voice actor known for his elaborate, "borderline surreal" engagement-based livestreams on Twitch.[4][5] </p>

    <p>Jerma did not fully transition into Twitch streaming until 2016.[25] He primarily streams video games (such as The Sims) while interacting with viewers in the chat.[26] After transitioning to Twitch as a main platform, he became well known for his "unconventional streams" and green screen performances, which fans used to edit comedic videos.[27]

        On September 21, 2019, Jerma hosted a real-life "robot carnival" stream that used viewer-controlled robots, allowing members of the live stream chat to control the aim in carnival games such as ring toss and dunk tank.[28][29]
        
        In March 2021, Jerma hosted a real-life archaeology and geology stream with a paleontologist from the Nevada Science Center.[30] In the stream, he "unearthed" Grotto Beasts, a fictitious trading card game from the 1990s based on Pokémon.[31] The cards were produced in collaboration with multiple artists. Fans played along with the joke, producing fan art in the form of found footage-style art, such as a website for the eponymous card game made to resemble a GeoCities webpage from the 1990s.[32][30] In early 2022, Jerma donated $10,000 to the Nevada Science Center.[33]
        
        In August 2021, Jerma began his real-life The Sims-inspired "Dollhouse" streams, which he described as his "biggest project yet".[34] The first of three streams, entitled "The Jerma985 Dollhouse", was aired on August 18 and began with a prerecorded video of Jerma choosing his outfit. The streams allowed viewers to control Jerma's actions similar to the way one would control a Sims character: keep him fed, happy, healthy and energetic.[4][35] The Dollhouse series is notable for its high production value[36] as well as the level of control that viewers were allowed to have over the events of the stream.[37] These streams used a combination of visual effects and a real set.
        
        On February 1, 2022, Jerma livestreamed the "Who Will Replace ME?"[38] show on Twitch. The show featured various actors playing the parts of aspiring individuals auditioning for the chance to take over Jerma's Twitch channel. Viewers were able to vote for the winner and chose actor Ryan Manuel's[39] character, "#13", in a Twitch poll.[40] On February 4, 2022, Jerma featured the character "#13" on his channel again in a follow-up stream of the character commentating over Destiny 2 gameplay, pretending to have taken over Jerma's channel.[41][failed verification]
        
        In early 2022, Jerma signed a partnership deal with Evolved Talent Agency to help fund his upcoming large-stream events, which are each an expensive venture for him to produce. The 2019 "Carnival Stream" cost over $40,000, and The Jerma985 Dollhouse cost even more, requiring a sponsorship deal with Coinbase.[42]
        
        On August 19, 2022, Jerma hosted a streamed baseball game[43] at CarShield Field, featuring the fictitious Jerma Baseball Association. He later compared the game to a "live comedy improv show".[44] During the stream, two fictitious and comedic baseball teams, the Maryland Magicians and the California Circus (the teams were made up of semi-professional baseball players and circus performers), played a modified game of baseball with various gimmicks,[44] such as "Power Cards" which provided advantages to the team that played them. Jerma played the role of the umpire.[44][45] This event was viewed by over 250,000 viewers online,[46][non-primary source needed] and received financial support from sponsors Fansly and Manscaped.[44]
        
        Most recently, on December 17, 2022, Jerma hosted the 'Jerma Christmas Special'.[47] This stream is most notable for being 'hacked' by The Extinguisher,[48] in which he played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II's campaign mode. This stream was produced by Beyond The Summit, a popular esports production company.
        
        He has collaborated with other content creators, such as Ludwig Ahgren,[49] Kitboga, and members of the Vinesauce streaming group. </p>
